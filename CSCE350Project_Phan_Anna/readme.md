# Programming Project written by Anna Phan

This project ia a guicksort algorithm that is based on the textbook.

## Compiling in Terminal

To compile in the terminal without makeFile would be:

```bash
g++ -Wall -std=c++11 QuickSort_Phan_Anna_.cpp -o quickSort 
```

## Compiling with makeFile

To compile with the makeFile, run the following:

```bash
make compile
```

## Compiling and Runnning Through MakeFile

There are four other functions in the makeFile besides 'compile'. Three of them are the different input sizes and one is the input file generator.

1. Input sizes [10, 100, 1000]
```bash
make ten
make hundred
make thousand
```

2. input file generator
```bash
make inputFileGenerator
```

## Command Line Arguments

./quickSort [inputFile] [outputFile]

inputFile: A text file that contains numbers from -100 to 100 that is unsorted. Every number is seperated with a space (" ").
outputFile: A text file with the sort number that was in the inputFile. 

## Cleaning

To clean, use makeFile function clean. It will delete the files that were generated by the generator and the unix executable files. 

```bash
make clean
```
